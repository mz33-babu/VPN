### *Step 1:*
**Create a droplet**

First, you have to create a new droplet: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/

The cheapest option (5$) with Ubuntu 18.04 will suffice.

Don’t forget to add your ssh key to make possible further operations with the droplet via ssh: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/
#### Adding `ssh` Keys
  i)  On your local machine(Linux), run `ssh-keygen`
The utility prompts you to select a location for the keys. By default, the keys are stored in the `~/.ssh` directory with the filenames `id_rsa` for the private key and `id_rsa.pub` for the public key. Using the default locations allows your `SSH` client to automatically find your `SSH` keys when authenticating, so we recommend accepting them by pressing `ENTER`.

Once you select a location for the key, you’ll be prompted to enter an optional passphrase which encrypts the private key file on disk.
If you enter one, you will have to provide it every time you use this key (unless you are running SSH agent software that stores the decrypted key). We recommend using a passphrase, but you can press `ENTER` to bypass this prompt.

This is the last step in the creation process. You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate.

After you create an SSH key pair, you can upload your public key to DigitalOcean teams to make it easier to add your keys to your Droplets. It’s safe to freely share your SSH public key because it cannot be used to re-create the private key. It can only be used to validate the user who holds the associated private key.

### *Step 2:*
**Set up a server and prepare all the necessary configs**

To create all configs and set up the WireGuard server automatically you have to use wg-ubuntu-server-up.sh script that:
```
    Installs all necessary software
    Configures IPv4 forwarding and iptables rules
    Sets up unbound dns resolver
    Creates a server and clients configurations
    Runs WireGuard
```
Establish a connection to the droplet via ssh and execute the following commands to download and execute the script (use your droplet’s IP address instead of xxx.xxx.x.xx):

`ssh root@xxx.xxx.x.xxwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drew2a/wireguard/master/wg-ubuntu-server-up.sh`
```
    chmod +x ./wg-ubuntu-server-up.sh
    sudo ./wg-ubuntu-server-up.sh`
```
After the commands are executed, the WireGuard server will starts.

The tail of the successful script’s output should look like this:
```
    interface: wg0public key: +xxxEjj1qmxxxotq4OxxxfHPaxxxtre5xxxxOfxxw=
    private key: (hidden)listening port: 51820
    peer: d1exxxLdCZcYxxxIQ0xxxxK/Wpx8G1N8xxvnUrxxxx=allowed ips: 10.0.0.2/32
    peer: fWExxxazRxxxUOxxxx4JKgUTxxo9LaxxxxOGWtxxK0w=allowed ips: 10.0.0.3/32
```
The scripts created 10 client configs [client1.conf…client10.conf] that located in droplet’s folder $HOME/wireguard/.

Now you can use one config per one device.

### *Step 3:*
**Set up a desktop client**

Download the WireGuard Application from https://www.wireguard.com/install/ and install it.

Download a client config (e.g. client1.conf) from the droplet (use your droplet’s IP address instead of xxx.xxx.x.xx):
```
    peer: RbmxxxDxOoXMxxxcyate6xxxinIClxxDgRDxxxx0j0=allowed ips: 10.0.0.4/32
    scp root@xxx.xxx.x.xx:"~/wireguard/client1.conf" ~/Desktop/
```
Run the GUI and import tunnel from the local file ~/Desktop/client1.conf.

Set up a mobile client

Go to your mobile device and install the WireGuard Application via AppStore or PlayMarket.

Run the WireGuard Application, and add a tunnel via “create from QR code”.

### How to get a QR code

You can generate the QR code by connecting to the droplet and executing the following command (in case you want to import client2.conf):
     `qrencode -t ansiutf8 < ~/wireguard/client2.conf`

#### **For Linux Command Line Setup**

Install wireguard: `sudo apt install wireguard`

Copy the downloaded config, `client2.conf` file to ` /etc/wireguard/` and rename it to `wg0`
```
cp client2.conf /etc/wireguard/
mv client2.conf wg0
```
Run `wg-quick up wg0` to bring up the wireguard interface.

On browser, run dnsleaktest: https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ to ascertain proper configuration.

To bring the interface down, run `wg-quick down wg0`
